# Snapback Stability & Latch-Up

## Negative Differential Resistance (NDR)

\[
\frac{dV}{dI} < 0
\]

NDR can cause instability when combined with inductance.

---

## Oscillation Condition

Inductance + NDR region can create transient ringing.

---

## Latch-Up Risk

SCR may remain on if:

- Holding current not reduced
- EOS event sustains current

---

## Design Strategies

- Minimize parasitic inductance
- Optimize holding voltage
- Use trigger-controlled SCR
- Kelvin ground routing
