# Effect of Parasitic L on Snapback

## Snapback Basics

- Trigger voltage: Vt1
- Holding voltage: Vh
- Negative differential resistance

---

## With Inductance

\[
V = V_{snapback} + L \frac{dI}{dt}
\]

Inductance delays current rise.

## Consequences

1. Higher peak voltage
2. Delayed triggering
3. Increased overshoot
4. Possible oscillation (with NDR)

## Example

L = 3 nH  
dI/dt = 20 A/ns  

\[
V = 60V
\]

Dynamic clamp much higher than static clamp.
