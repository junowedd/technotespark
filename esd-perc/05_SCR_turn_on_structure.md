# SCR Turn-On Mechanism

## Structure

PNPN layers:

P+ – N-well – P-sub – N+

Contains:
- NPN transistor
- PNP transistor

---

## Regenerative Condition

\[
\beta_{NPN} \times \beta_{PNP} > 1
\]

---

## Turn-On Process

1. Trigger event
2. NPN turns on
3. Collector current feeds PNP base
4. PNP turns on
5. Positive feedback
6. Latch-on

## Characteristics

- Very low on-resistance
- Strong snapback
- High current capability
- Latch risk
