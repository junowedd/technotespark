# 6. Inductance vs Snapback Interaction

## Combined Equation

\[
V_{total} = V_{device} + L \frac{dI}{dt}
\]

## Key Insight

Even in low-impedance state:

Inductance adds dynamic voltage.

---

## Consequences

- Higher peak voltage
- Delayed triggering
- Overshoot amplification
- Possible oscillation
