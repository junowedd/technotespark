# 8. Practical Design Guidelines

## Minimize Inductance

- Short return path
- Kelvin ground
- Multiple vias
- Flip-chip packaging

---

## Snapback Control

- Optimize holding voltage
- Control trigger current
- Avoid excessive NDR

---

## System-Level Strategy

\[
V_{system} = V_{clamp} + L \frac{dI}{dt}
\]

Both device and layout must be co-optimized.
