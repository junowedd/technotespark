I’m aligned on:

the role scope (Senior Engineer, Supplier Quality Management for Fabless Semiconductor Solutions),

the technical focus (ASICs, foundry/OSAT/test suppliers, zero-defect strategy, qualification, failure analysis, KPIs),

the automotive quality framework (APQP, PPAP, VDA 6.3, IATF 16949),

and the organizational context (AUMOVIO as Continental Automotive spin-off, global supplier ecosystem).

Perfect, this role lives on these topics. Let’s break them down practically, the way an interviewer or hiring manager at AUMOVIO / Continental will expect you to understand them — especially in a fabless semiconductor + supplier quality context.

1️⃣ KPIs in Supplier Quality – Semiconductor / Automotive Context

For this role, KPIs are not generic dashboards — they’re used to control supplier risk, detect drift early, and enforce zero-defect culture.

🔑 Core Supplier Quality KPIs (expected knowledge)
 
 Quality Performance

  PPM (Parts Per Million defects)

    Primary KPI for automotive suppliers

    Often split into:

      Incoming PPM

      Customer PPM

      PPM per product / technology node

Zero Defect Escapes

  Any defect reaching Continental / OEM

  Treated as critical events, often escalated

Failure Rate / DPPM Trend

  Trend stability is more important than absolute number

Problem Resolution

  8D Closure Rate & Timeliness

    % of 8Ds closed on time

    Quality of root cause (esp. physical FA)

  Repeat Failure Rate

    Killer KPI → indicates weak corrective actions
