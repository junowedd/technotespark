  <h1>About TechNotesPark</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Engineering practice across EDA, automation, and AI-assisted workflows
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    TechNotesPark is my personal technical workspace documenting how long-standing
    semiconductor and EDA experience evolves through modern automation,
    data-driven analysis, and AI-assisted engineering workflows.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the foundation of this site is rooted in physical verification,
    sign-off ownership, and manufacturing readiness for advanced ASIC programs,
    it also captures how these practices are continuously extended using
    Python-based automation and structured experimentation with AI.
  </p>

  <h2>My Engineering Background</h2>
  <p>
    I am a senior semiconductor professional with over 29 years of experience
    spanning physical verification, sign-off methodology, and design-to-manufacturing
    enablement across EMEA and APAC.
  </p>

  <p>
    My career has focused on advanced-node verification challenges including
    DRC, LVS, PERC, RET, and foundry-facing sign-off, often acting as the bridge
    between EDA technology, customer design teams, and executive stakeholders.
  </p>

  <h2>From Sign-off Expertise to Scalable Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    In advanced technology nodes, layout quality is no longer determined
    by geometry alone, but by how effectively design freedom is constrained.
    My work emphasizes layout architecture and methodology design,
    defining which degrees of freedom must be exposed—and which must be forbidden—
    to ensure manufacturability, yield stability, and predictable OPC convergence.
  </p>

  <p>
    This perspective naturally extends into automation:
    encoding engineering judgment into PCell architectures,
    rule-aware flows, and repeatable verification frameworks
    rather than relying on downstream sign-off correction.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Python and AI</h2>
  <p>
    Python serves as a practical bridge between engineering intuition
    and scalable execution. It enables rapid automation,
    data exploration, and reproducible analysis rooted in real EDA problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    In parallel, my AI and Claude Code explorations focus on augmenting
    engineering reasoning—using large language models to clarify intent,
    explore alternatives, and accelerate iteration without replacing
    human judgment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, Python and AI form an extension of my existing practice:
    formalizing experience into workflows and amplifying structured thinking
    in complex, constraint-driven engineering environments.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>
      Engineering quality is achieved when constraints are encoded early,
      not enforced late.
    </strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Whether through PCell architecture, verification methodology,
    Python automation, or AI-assisted reasoning,
    my focus remains the same: reducing ambiguity,
    improving predictability, and enabling scalable engineering execution.
