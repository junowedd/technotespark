    Engineering practice across EDA, automation, and AI-assisted workflows
  </p>

  <h3>Domain Overview (EDA & Manufacturing Foundations)</h3>
  <p>
    TechNotesPark is my personal technical workspace documenting how long-standing
    semiconductor and EDA experience evolves through modern automation,
    data-driven analysis, and AI-assisted engineering workflows.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site intentionally combines two dimensions:
    deep, production-grade EDA and manufacturing sign-off expertise,
    and continuous evolution through Python-based automation and AI-assisted reasoning.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Read This Site</h2>
  <p>
    The sections below preserve detailed, domain-specific knowledge accumulated
    across advanced-node programs, sign-off ownership, and foundry-facing engagements.
    These foundations are complemented by newer tracks focused on scalability,
    automation, and reasoning augmentation.

  <h2>Engineering Foundations & Detailed Domain Work</h2>
  
  <h1>About TechNotesPark</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Semiconductor Physical Verification & Manufacturing Readiness Portfolio
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    TechNotesPark is a personal technical portfolio covering physical verification,
    EDA sign-off methodologies, and design-to-manufacturing workflows across
    advanced ASIC and foundry programs.
  </p>

  <p>
  In advanced technology nodes (12nm and below),
  my focus extends beyond verification execution
  to <strong>layout architecture and methodology design</strong>.
  This includes defining which layout freedoms must be exposed,
  and more importantly, which must be <em>forbidden</em>
  to ensure manufacturability, yield, and OPC convergence.
  </p>


<h2>From Sign-off Expertise to Scalable Methodology</h2>

<p>
  In advanced technology nodes, layout quality is no longer determined
  by geometry alone, but by how effectively design freedom is constrained.
  My work emphasizes layout architecture and methodology design—defining
  which degrees of freedom must be exposed, and which must be deliberately
  forbidden—to ensure manufacturability, yield stability, and predictable
  OPC convergence.
</p>

<p>
  This perspective naturally extends into automation.
  Rather than relying on downstream sign-off correction,
  engineering judgment is encoded directly into PCell architectures,
  rule-aware flows, and repeatable verification frameworks.
</p>

<h2>Why Python and AI</h2>

<p>
  Python serves as a practical bridge between engineering intuition
  and scalable execution. It enables rapid automation, structured data
  exploration, and reproducible analysis grounded in real EDA problems.
</p>

<p>
  In parallel, my AI and Claude Code explorations focus on augmenting
  engineering reasoning—using large language models to clarify intent,
  explore alternatives, and accelerate iteration without replacing
  human judgment.
</p>

<p>
  Together, Python and AI extend my existing practice by formalizing
  experience into workflows and amplifying structured thinking in
  complex, constraint-driven engineering environments.
</p>


  <p>
  A key part of this work is the design of
  <strong>PCell architectures</strong> for planar and FinFET technologies,
  where topology, technology rules, and DFM constraints
  are encoded directly into automation flows.
  </p>

  <h2>My Role & Background</h2>
  <p>
    I am a senior semiconductor professional with over 29 years of experience spanning
    physical verification, sign-off ownership, and design-to-manufacturing enablement
    across EMEA and APAC.
  </p>
  <p>
    My work has focused on foundry-facing verification methodologies, including DRC,
    LVS, PERC, RET, and manufacturing readiness at advanced and legacy nodes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have supported complex ASIC and packaging programs by bridging EDA technology,
    customer design challenges, and business objectives, while leading high-value B2B
    engagements with engineering and executive stakeholders.
  </p>

  <p>
  More recently, my work has emphasized
  <strong>advanced-node layout methodology</strong>,
  particularly the transition from geometry-driven design
  to <strong>constraint- and topology-driven architectures</strong>.
  This shift is essential for scaling layout quality
  across FinFET-based nodes where OPC freedom is limited
  and manufacturing variability is amplified.
  </p>


  <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Design tools create layouts.<br>
    Sign-off tools decide manufacturability.</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  In advanced nodes, this philosophy extends one step further:
  manufacturability must be designed <em>before</em> sign-off.
  Well-architected PCells and layout automation
  should prevent invalid structures from being created at all,
  rather than relying on downstream fixes.
  </p>

  <h2>Advanced-Node Layout Architecture</h2>

<p>
  Below 14nm, layout challenges are dominated not by rule complexity,
  but by interacting constraints across lithography, process variability,
  and limited OPC correction capability.
</p>

<p>
  My approach to advanced-node layout architecture focuses on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminating non-physical degrees of freedom (e.g. continuous width in FinFETs)</li>
  <li>Encoding DFM and OPC constraints directly at the PCell level</li>
  <li>Separating exploration (PCM) from production-ready design rules</li>
  <li>Designing layout automation that scales across teams and technologies</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This architectural perspective complements traditional sign-off expertise
  by shifting risk mitigation earlier in the design flow.
</p>
