  <h1>About TechNotesPark</h1>

    Semiconductor Physical Verification & Manufacturing Readiness Portfolio
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    TechNotesPark is a personal technical portfolio covering physical verification,
    EDA sign-off methodologies, and design-to-manufacturing workflows across
    advanced ASIC and foundry programs.
  </p>

  <p>
  In advanced technology nodes (12nm and below),
  my focus extends beyond verification execution
  to <strong>layout architecture and methodology design</strong>.
  This includes defining which layout freedoms must be exposed,
  and more importantly, which must be <em>forbidden</em>
  to ensure manufacturability, yield, and OPC convergence.
  </p>

  <p>
  A key part of this work is the design of
  <strong>PCell architectures</strong> for planar and FinFET technologies,
  where topology, technology rules, and DFM constraints
  are encoded directly into automation flows.
  </p>

  <h2>My Role & Background</h2>
  <p>
    I am a senior semiconductor professional with over 29 years of experience spanning
    physical verification, sign-off ownership, and design-to-manufacturing enablement
    across EMEA and APAC.
  </p>
  <p>
    My work has focused on foundry-facing verification methodologies, including DRC,
    LVS, PERC, RET, and manufacturing readiness at advanced and legacy nodes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have supported complex ASIC and packaging programs by bridging EDA technology,
    customer design challenges, and business objectives, while leading high-value B2B
    engagements with engineering and executive stakeholders.
  </p>

  <p>
  More recently, my work has emphasized
  <strong>advanced-node layout methodology</strong>,
  particularly the transition from geometry-driven design
  to <strong>constraint- and topology-driven architectures</strong>.
  This shift is essential for scaling layout quality
  across FinFET-based nodes where OPC freedom is limited
  and manufacturing variability is amplified.
  </p>


  <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Design tools create layouts.<br>
    Sign-off tools decide manufacturability.</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  In advanced nodes, this philosophy extends one step further:
  manufacturability must be designed <em>before</em> sign-off.
  Well-architected PCells and layout automation
  should prevent invalid structures from being created at all,
  rather than relying on downstream fixes.
  </p>

  <h2>Advanced-Node Layout Architecture</h2>

<p>
  Below 14nm, layout challenges are dominated not by rule complexity,
  but by interacting constraints across lithography, process variability,
  and limited OPC correction capability.
</p>

<p>
  My approach to advanced-node layout architecture focuses on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminating non-physical degrees of freedom (e.g. continuous width in FinFETs)</li>
  <li>Encoding DFM and OPC constraints directly at the PCell level</li>
  <li>Separating exploration (PCM) from production-ready design rules</li>
  <li>Designing layout automation that scales across teams and technologies</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This architectural perspective complements traditional sign-off expertise
  by shifting risk mitigation earlier in the design flow.
</p>
