<h1>Production-Grade AI in Semiconductor Manufacturing</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
Why MLOps Was the Decisive Factor
</p>

<h2>Project Context</h2>
<p>
This case study focuses on deploying AI in a semiconductor manufacturing environment, where
requirements around yield, reliability, traceability, and production sign-off are significantly
higher than in typical software-driven AI use cases.
</p>
<p>
The goal was not experimental modeling, but supporting real production decisions such as
process control, inspection analysis, and manufacturing readiness.
In this environment, AI failures directly translate into cost, yield loss, or qualification risk.
</p>

<h2>Two Complementary Views of AI</h2>

<h3>AI Taxonomy (What Exists)</h3>
<img src="images/layers_of_ai_taxonomy.png" alt="AI Taxonomy Layers">
<p>
This view describes the evolution of AI capabilities, from classical AI to machine learning,
deep learning, and modern generative and agentic systems.
It explains <strong>what kinds of models exist</strong>, but not how they operate reliably in production.
</p>

<h3>AI as a System (How It Works in Production)</h3>
<img src="images/layers_of_ai_rounded_mlops_emphasis.png" alt="AI System Architecture">
<p>
This system-level view represents AI as an engineered pipeline composed of infrastructure,
data, training, models, operations, applications, and business decisions.
It explains <strong>how AI delivers value in real environments</strong>.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
A powerful model without operations is a prototype.  
A system with strong operations becomes infrastructure.
</div>

<h2>Why MLOps Was the Central Layer</h2>
<p>
In practice, most AI failures occur outside the model itself.
Data changes, tool updates, process evolution, and deployment mistakes introduce silent risk.
</p>
<p>
MLOps enabled:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reliable deployment and serving</li>
  <li>Monitoring, drift detection, and retraining</li>
  <li>Versioning, traceability, and governance</li>
  <li>Trustworthy integration into manufacturing workflows</li>
</ul>

<p>
Without MLOps, AI remains a demo.  
With MLOps, AI becomes a production system.
</p>

<h2>Layer-by-Layer System Mapping</h2>

<h3>1. Compute & Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
The system ran on fab-compatible infrastructure, balancing compute availability,
security, and latency. Predictable inference timing was critical to align with
manufacturing takt time.
</p>

<h3>2. Data Engineering</h3>
<p>
Manufacturing data came from inspection tools, metrology systems, and process logs.
Pipelines handled schema evolution, tool changes, and strict data quality requirements.
</p>

<h3>3. Training & Feature Engineering</h3>
<p>
Feature engineering focused on process-relevant representations.
Training workflows emphasized repeatability, traceability, and stability over marginal accuracy gains.
</p>

<h3>4. Models</h3>
<p>
Models were chosen for robustness and explainability.
They were deliberately treated as replaceable components, not the center of the system.
</p>

<h3>5. ⭐ MLOps & Operations</h3>
<p>
This was the enabling layer that made AI acceptable in production.
Monitoring, drift detection, controlled retraining, and versioning ensured
ongoing validity as processes evolved.
</p>

<h3>6. Applications & Human-in-the-Loop</h3>
<p>
AI outputs supported engineers with clear decision boundaries.
Automation was constrained, and accountability was preserved through human oversight.
</p>

<h3>7. Business & Decisions</h3>
<p>
Success was measured by adoption, trust, and sustained reliability —
not by offline model metrics alone.
</p>

<h2>Concrete Manufacturing Examples</h2>

<h3>Inspection Drift Detection</h3>
<p>
Gradual tool and process changes caused distribution drift.
Monitoring detected issues early, enabling retraining before yield impact occurred.
</p>

<h3>Tool Configuration Changes</h3>
<p>
Tool metadata was versioned alongside data and models.
Compatibility checks and rollback mechanisms ensured safe operation after maintenance events.
</p>

<h3>Process Node Migration</h3>
<p>
During node transitions, phased retraining and explicit model-to-node mapping
enabled safe adaptation with engineering oversight.
</p>

<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
<div class="highlight">
In semiconductor manufacturing, AI maturity is defined by operational trust — not model novelty.
<br><br>
MLOps is not a support function.  
It is the control layer that makes AI acceptable in production fabs.
</div>

<h2>Interview-Ready Summary</h2>
<p>
“Building AI models is not the hard part in manufacturing.
Making them trustworthy, traceable, and controllable is.
That transition happens in MLOps.”
