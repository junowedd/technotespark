  <!-- Context -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Manufacturing organizations increasingly rely on industrial IoT (IIoT) technologies
      to improve productivity, quality, and operational resilience. However, many struggle
      to extract actionable value from growing volumes of asset and process data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disconnected systems, siloed data, and inconsistent analytics across plants limit
      the effectiveness of digital transformation initiatives—especially in large,
      multi-site manufacturing environments.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenge -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional manufacturing IT landscapes often consist of fragmented solutions
      spanning shop-floor devices, manufacturing execution systems, and enterprise platforms.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited visibility across assets, processes, and facilities</li>
      <li>Inconsistent data models and analytics between sites</li>
      <li>Difficulty scaling IIoT initiatives beyond pilot projects</li>
      <li>Concerns around security, compliance, and data governance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These challenges prevent organizations from fully leveraging IIoT to drive
      continuous improvement and operational excellence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why traditional approaches fall short -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short</h2>
    <p>
      Point solutions and custom-built integrations address isolated problems but fail
      to deliver a unified, scalable foundation for data-driven manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a common data model and integrated analytics, organizations struggle to
      contextualize raw sensor data and translate insights into consistent operational action.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>
      A unified industrial IoT platform approach was adopted to integrate asset, process,
      and enterprise data into a single, secure environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      By combining industrial IoT capabilities with manufacturing execution systems (MES),
      organizations were able to contextualize data, apply advanced analytics, and support
      continuous improvement methodologies across the enterprise.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Technical execution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Native integration of industrial protocols and edge connectivity</li>
      <li>Unified data modeling to abstract raw sensor data into semantic “things”</li>
      <li>Advanced analytics leveraging AI and machine learning</li>
      <li>Integration of asset, production, and quality data</li>
      <li>Secure, scalable deployment across cloud, virtual, and on-prem environments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This architecture enabled consistent analytics and decision-making across multiple
      plants while maintaining strong security and governance controls.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved operational visibility across assets and processes</li>
      <li>Accelerated continuous improvement using data-driven insights</li>
      <li>Scalable IIoT deployment across multiple facilities</li>
      <li>Enhanced security, compliance, and data governance</li>
      <li>Stronger alignment between IT, OT, and business stakeholders</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Takeaway -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      Successful industrial digital transformation requires more than isolated IIoT tools.
      A unified, secure industrial IoT platform provides the foundation for scalable,
      data-driven manufacturing and sustained operational excellence.
