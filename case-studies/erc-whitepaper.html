      Electrical Rule Checking (ERC) as a design-intent and reliability
      verification methodology beyond traditional DRC and LVS.

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Electrical Rule Checking (ERC) complements DRC and LVS by focusing on
      electrical correctness, voltage intent, and reliability risks.
      This case study consolidates practical ERC usage together with
      foundry- and safety-oriented concepts commonly applied in real
      semiconductor projects.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <section>
    <h2>1. Practical ERC Checks (Design-Level)</h2>
    <p>
      This section covers fundamental ERC checks that detect common but
      critical design issues early in the development cycle.
    </p>

    <h3>Floating Gate / Floating Net</h3>
    <p>
      Detects MOS gates or nets that are not driven. Floating gates can cause
      unpredictable behavior, especially in analog, sensor, and automotive ICs.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
ERC FLOATING_GATE
  DEVICE MOS
  TERMINAL GATE
  CONDITION NOT CONNECTED
END
    </code></pre>

    <h3>VDD–VSS Short</h3>
    <p>
      Detects shorts between power and ground that may not be caught by LVS alone.
    </p>

    <h3>Multiple Driver on a Net</h3>
    <p>
      Identifies nets driven by multiple outputs, preventing contention and
      long-term reliability issues.
    </p>

    <h3>Well Tie and Bulk Connection</h3>
    <p>
      Ensures proper NWELL/PWELL and bulk connections to prevent latch-up and
      leakage issues.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <section>
    <h2>2. Foundry-Style ERC (GlobalFoundries Perspective)</h2>
    <p>
      Foundry-style ERC encodes manufacturing, voltage, and reliability intent
      directly into rule decks.
    </p>

    <h3>Voltage Domain Crossing</h3>
    <p>
      ERC rules enforce the presence of level shifters between voltage domains
      to avoid gate-oxide stress.
    </p>

    <h3>Over-Voltage Device Protection</h3>
    <p>
      Checks correct usage of high-voltage and low-voltage devices across
      different voltage domains.
    </p>

    <h3>Power Sequencing and Back-Powering</h3>
    <p>
      Detects unsafe power-up sequences that may cause unintended current paths,
      especially critical for automotive ECUs.
    </p>

    <h3>Safety-Critical Signal Integrity</h3>
    <p>
      Ensures that safety-related signals are never floating or multiply driven.
    </p>

    <h3>ESD Protection Path Verification</h3>
    <p>
      Verifies that all IO pads have valid ESD discharge paths.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONCLUSION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Effective ERC is not a checkbox exercise but a way to encode design intent
      and reliability requirements into verification flows. When used correctly,
      ERC significantly reduces late-stage failures and improves sign-off
      confidence.
