      Applying structured package implementation and verification workflows

  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section>
    <p>
      As advanced packaging technologies such as chiplet-based architectures
      and 2.5D/3D IC integration become mainstream, the complexity of package
      design and verification has increased significantly. This case study
      describes how a structured workflow enables early risk mitigation and
      reliable manufacturing handoff.
    </p>

  <!-- CHALLENGE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Modern IC packages integrate multiple heterogeneous dies, each with
      different process technologies, power domains, and assembly constraints.
      Ensuring correct connectivity, manufacturability, and compliance across
      dies and layers is a significant technical challenge. Late error discovery
      often leads to costly redesign cycles.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SOLUTION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      A structured package implementation flow was established using an
      interactive physical design environment. Logical connectivity was
      translated into detailed physical geometry, including substrate stack-ups,
      redistribution layers, and die-to-die routing. Early in-design verification
      enabled rapid identification and correction of geometry and connectivity
      issues.

    <p class="diagram-explanation">
    This workflow illustrates how package designs evolve from logical assembly
    to physical implementation, followed by early in-design verification.
    Final manufacturing readiness is ensured through sign-off-level 3D
    verification, clearly separating fast iterative checks from authoritative
    validation.

  <!-- VERIFICATION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Verification Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      In-design verification provided fast feedback during implementation,
      while final manufacturing readiness was ensured through sign-off-level
      3D verification. Design data was exported for comprehensive cross-die
      checking, alignment validation, and assembly rule verification.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- RESULTS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      The combined approach significantly reduced late-stage errors and
      iteration cycles. Most design issues were resolved during early
      implementation, increasing overall development efficiency and confidence
      prior to manufacturing handoff.
