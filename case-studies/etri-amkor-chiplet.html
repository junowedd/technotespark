        This case study outlines a system-level approach to designing
        a high-performance AI neural processing unit (NPU) using
        chiplet-based 3D IC packaging.
        The focus was on improving computational scalability and
        memory bandwidth while managing power efficiency and
        manufacturing complexity.

    <!-- CHALLENGE -->
    <section>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The project required integrating multiple high-performance
        compute and memory components into a single package.
        Key challenges included managing signal integrity,
        thermal stability, interposer manufacturability, and
        verification of a highly complex multi-die architecture
        under practical design constraints.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SOLUTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        To address these challenges, a chiplet-based architecture
        combined with advanced 3D IC packaging was adopted.
        The design integrated multiple AI NPU chiplets and
        high-bandwidth memory stacks on a large-scale
        redistribution-layer (RDL) interposer.
        A systematic design and verification flow was applied
        to support early architectural modeling and reduce
        implementation risks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- RESULTS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        As a result, the approach enabled the realization of
        an ultra-high-performance AI processor architecture
        with improved energy efficiency.
        The solution demonstrated the feasibility of scaling
        compute and memory resources through heterogeneous
        chiplet integration.
