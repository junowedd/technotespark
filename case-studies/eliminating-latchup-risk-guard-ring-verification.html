  <!-- Sales summary -->
  <section class="case-summary">
    <p>
      Prevented ESD-induced latch-up failures in advanced IC designs by introducing
      automated, ESDA-compliant guard ring verification.
      This approach enabled early risk detection, improved reliability confidence,
      and reduced late-stage rework and time-to-market pressure.

  <!-- Context -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      As integrated circuits scale in complexity and sensitivity, reliability threats
      such as electrostatic discharge (ESD) and latch-up pose significant risks to product
      quality, yield, and long-term performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Latch-up events—often triggered by ESD or voltage transients—can lead to uncontrolled
      current flow, thermal damage, and complete functional failure, making prevention a
      critical requirement in automotive, industrial, and safety-critical designs.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenge -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Guard rings are a proven technique for mitigating latch-up by absorbing minority
      carriers and isolating sensitive circuit regions. However, ensuring correct guard
      ring implementation across large, complex layouts is non-trivial.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing or incomplete guard ring structures</li>
      <li>Insufficient width or spacing relative to aggressors</li>
      <li>Unprotected victims within high-risk danger zones</li>
      <li>Incorrect or missing guard ring bias connections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These issues are difficult to detect manually and often remain hidden until late
      verification stages—or after silicon failure.
    </p>

  <!-- Why traditional checks fall short -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional Checks Fall Short</h2>
    <p>
      Standard DRC and LVS flows focus on geometric correctness and connectivity but lack
      semantic awareness of latch-up risk scenarios defined by ESDA guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, layouts may pass sign-off checks while still containing latent latch-up
      vulnerabilities related to guard ring placement, coverage, or connectivity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>
      To close this verification gap, an automated reliability verification flow was
      introduced using pre-coded, ESDA-compliant latch-up guard ring checks within a
      Calibre PERC-based methodology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective was to systematically verify the presence, quality, and effectiveness
      of guard ring structures early in the design cycle—without manual rule coding.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Technical execution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Verification of guard ring existence around sensitive devices</li>
      <li>Width and spacing checks against ESDA-defined requirements</li>
      <li>Identification of unprotected victims in aggressor danger zones</li>
      <li>Validation of correct guard ring connectivity and biasing</li>
      <li>Centralized visualization and debugging of violations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These automated checks provided consistent, repeatable coverage across the entire
      layout, independent of design size or hierarchy depth.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Early detection of latch-up risks during physical design</li>
      <li>Improved compliance with ESDA reliability guidelines</li>
      <li>Reduced late-stage redesign and debug cycles</li>
      <li>Higher confidence in silicon reliability and robustness</li>
      <li>Shortened time-to-market through proactive verification</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Takeaway -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      Latch-up prevention cannot rely on assumption or manual inspection.
      Automated, standards-based guard ring verification is essential to achieving
      predictable reliability and robust sign-off in modern IC designs.
