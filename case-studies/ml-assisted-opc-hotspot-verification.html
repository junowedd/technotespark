    <p>
      Enabled scalable lithography hotspot detection by replacing complex rule-based OPC
      verification with machine learning–assisted pattern classification.
      This approach reduced hotspot noise by orders of magnitude, improved wafer inspection
      efficiency, and strengthened yield confidence in advanced manufacturing.

  <!-- Context -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      As semiconductor manufacturing advances to smaller nodes, lithography variability
      becomes a dominant contributor to yield loss. Identifying true lithography hotspots
      early is critical to preventing systematic defects and yield excursions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optical and Process Correction (OPC) verification plays a key role in detecting
      potential printability issues, but traditional approaches struggle to scale with
      increasing layout complexity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenge -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Conventional OPC verification relies on highly tuned rule decks, complex constraints,
      and expert-driven filtering to identify problematic patterns.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Millions of reported hotspots obscuring true yield risks</li>
      <li>High effort required to develop and maintain rule-based filters</li>
      <li>Limited scalability for full-chip and wafer-level monitoring</li>
      <li>Inefficient SEM inspection due to excessive false positives</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These challenges increase verification cost while reducing confidence in hotspot
      detection results.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why traditional approaches fall short -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional OPC Verification Falls Short</h2>
    <p>
      Rule-based filtering depends on explicit knowledge of failure mechanisms and
      aggressive constraint tuning. As process interactions grow more complex, it becomes
      increasingly difficult to anticipate all critical patterns using static rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, verification teams must choose between excessive noise or the risk of
      missing true yield-killer defects.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>
      A machine learning–assisted OPC verification methodology was introduced to replace
      manual rule-based filtering with pattern classification powered by ML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of relying on numerous constraints, a simplified approach using a single
      constraint per failing mechanism was combined with ML models to accurately classify
      and prioritize true hotspots.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Technical execution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Feature extraction and data collection from known lithography failures</li>
      <li>Machine learning–based pattern classification for hotspot detection</li>
      <li>Application of trained ML models to full-chip OPC verification</li>
      <li>Significant reduction of duplicate and low-risk hotspot patterns</li>
      <li>Integration with wafer inspection and SEM review workflows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This approach enabled practical, full-chip hotspot monitoring without sacrificing
      detection accuracy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduction of unique hotspot counts from millions to thousands</li>
      <li>Improved signal-to-noise ratio for lithography verification</li>
      <li>More efficient SEM inspection and defect review</li>
      <li>Lower engineering effort to maintain verification flows</li>
      <li>Stronger yield confidence in advanced manufacturing nodes</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Takeaway -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      As lithography variability and layout complexity increase, rule-based OPC verification
      reaches its limits. Machine learning–assisted hotspot detection provides a scalable,
      data-driven path to improving yield, reducing verification cost, and enabling
      next-generation semiconductor manufacturing.
