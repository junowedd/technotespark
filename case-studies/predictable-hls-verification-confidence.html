  <section class="case-summary">
    <p>
      Improved confidence and predictability in High-Level Synthesis flows by introducing
      formal, coverage-driven verification from C++/SystemC to RTL.
      This approach reduced late-stage debug, ensured design intent preservation, and
      enabled production-quality hardware results from HLS methodologies.

  <!-- Context -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      High-Level Synthesis (HLS) allows hardware designers to describe design intent at
      higher abstraction levels using C++ or SystemC, enabling faster architecture
      exploration and RTL generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While HLS significantly accelerates development, many teams struggle to achieve
      production-quality results due to verification challenges and uncertainty around
      equivalence between high-level models and generated RTL.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenge -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      In traditional HLS flows, verification often becomes disconnected from the original
      C++/SystemC source.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficulty correlating RTL errors back to high-level source code</li>
      <li>Limited confidence that generated RTL truly matches golden C++ intent</li>
      <li>Misleading results from software-oriented C++ coverage tools</li>
      <li>Late discovery of functional mismatches during downstream RTL verification</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These gaps reduce trust in HLS and force teams to rely on manual debug and rework.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why traditional approaches fall short -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short</h2>
    <p>
      Conventional verification methodologies were designed for hand-written RTL and
      provide limited visibility into the semantics of high-level algorithmic code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software-based C++ coverage tools lack awareness of hardware constructs such as
      concurrency, state, and signal activity, leading to inaccurate coverage assessment
      and poor linkage to downstream RTL verification.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>
      A comprehensive High-Level Verification (HLV) strategy was introduced to verify and
      clean C++/SystemC designs before synthesis and formally prove equivalence between
      high-level code and generated RTL.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach integrated formal equivalence checking and hardware-aware coverage
      directly into the HLS flow.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Technical execution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Early verification and cleanup of C++/SystemC source code</li>
      <li>Formal equivalence checking between golden C++ and generated RTL</li>
      <li>Hardware-aware code coverage applied at the C++ level</li>
      <li>Linking high-level coverage results to RTL verification databases</li>
      <li>Clear traceability from algorithm intent to final RTL implementation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This methodology ensured that functional correctness and coverage closure were
      addressed at the appropriate abstraction level.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Earlier detection of functional and structural issues</li>
      <li>Reduced downstream RTL debug and re-verification effort</li>
      <li>Higher confidence in HLS-generated RTL quality</li>
      <li>Improved collaboration between algorithm, architecture, and RTL teams</li>
      <li>Production-ready HLS adoption with predictable outcomes</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Takeaway -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      High-Level Synthesis does not eliminate the need for rigorous hardware verification.
      By integrating formal equivalence and hardware-aware coverage into the HLS flow,
      teams can achieve both productivity gains and production-level confidence.
