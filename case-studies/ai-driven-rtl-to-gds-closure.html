    <p>
      Accelerated RTL-to-GDS closure by replacing manually crafted implementation flows
      with AI-generated, production-ready methodologies.
      This approach delivered faster convergence, improved PPA, and significantly higher
      engineering productivity under aggressive tape-out schedules.

  <!-- Context -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      As digital designs continue to grow in size and complexity, engineering teams face
      increasing pressure to meet aggressive performance, power, and area (PPA) targets
      while reducing time-to-tapeout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The RTL-to-GDS phase has become one of the most resource-intensive and schedule-
      critical stages of the design flow, often requiring extensive manual tuning and
      expert intervention.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenge -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional RTL-to-GDS methodologies rely heavily on manually developed flows,
      scripts, and incremental optimization loops.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Long iteration cycles driven by trial-and-error tuning</li>
      <li>Strong dependence on a small number of physical design experts</li>
      <li>Limited exploration of the overall design solution space</li>
      <li>Difficulty balancing PPA goals against schedule constraints</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As complexity increases, these manual approaches struggle to scale efficiently.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why traditional approaches fall short -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional RTL-to-GDS Approaches Fall Short</h2>
    <p>
      Manually crafted RTL-to-GDS flows are inherently static and constrained by human
      intuition and experience.
      They cannot efficiently explore the vast number of possible implementation
      strategies required for modern SoC designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, integrating AI techniques into existing flows often introduces
      excessive compute overhead and workflow disruption.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>
      An AI-native RTL-to-GDS strategy was adopted, embedding machine learning,
      reinforcement learning, generative AI, and agentic AI directly into the
      implementation flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of manually assembling flows, the system automatically generated
      optimized, production-ready RTL-to-GDS methodologies aligned with design priorities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Technical execution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>AI-driven design space exploration to identify optimal RTL-to-GDS flows</li>
      <li>Automated tuning of placement, routing, and optimization strategies</li>
      <li>Generative AI assist providing natural-language access to tool knowledge</li>
      <li>Agentic AI executing validated commands directly within the flow</li>
      <li>Transparent, reusable, and verifiable implementation methodologies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This approach balanced aggressive PPA targets with efficient compute utilization,
      reducing unnecessary iterations while maintaining sign-off confidence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Significant acceleration of RTL-to-GDS convergence</li>
      <li>Improved PPA compared to manually tuned flows</li>
      <li>Up to an order-of-magnitude productivity improvement for engineering teams</li>
      <li>Reduced compute waste through efficient AI-guided exploration</li>
      <li>Faster ramp-up and knowledge transfer across projects</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Takeaway -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      RTL-to-GDS implementation is no longer a manual, script-driven exercise.
      By embedding generative and agentic AI at the core of the flow, design teams can
      achieve faster closure, higher quality results, and sustainable productivity gains
      across advanced technology nodes.
