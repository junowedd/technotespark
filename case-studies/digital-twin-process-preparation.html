  <!-- Sales summary -->
  <section class="case-summary">
    <p>
      Enabled manufacturers to validate products and production processes virtually using
      digital twins and process preparation.
      This approach reduced physical trial-and-error, improved sustainability, and
      accelerated time-to-market while increasing operational confidence.

  <!-- Context -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Manufacturing organizations face growing pressure to deliver higher-quality products
      faster while reducing cost, waste, and environmental impact.
      At the same time, production systems are becoming more complex, distributed, and
      tightly integrated across the product lifecycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digital twins—virtual representations of products, processes, and systems—have
      emerged as a foundational technology to address these challenges by enabling
      simulation and optimization before physical execution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenge -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Traditionally, manufacturing readiness is validated through physical prototypes,
      pilot runs, and late-stage adjustments on the shop floor.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Costly trial-and-error during ramp-up</li>
      <li>Late discovery of process inefficiencies</li>
      <li>Increased material waste and energy consumption</li>
      <li>Delayed time-to-market due to rework</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These challenges limit agility and make it difficult to meet sustainability and
      efficiency goals.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why traditional approaches fall short -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short</h2>
    <p>
      Physical validation alone provides limited visibility into complex interactions
      between products, equipment, and processes.
      Issues are often discovered only after resources have already been committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a digital representation of manufacturing processes, organizations struggle
      to predict outcomes, optimize workflows, and scale best practices across facilities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>
      A digital manufacturing strategy was adopted, centered on digital twins and
      comprehensive process preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Production processes were designed, simulated, and optimized in a virtual
      environment—allowing manufacturers to validate performance, resource utilization,
      and sustainability metrics before physical execution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Technical execution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Creation of digital twins for products, equipment, and production lines</li>
      <li>Virtual simulation of manufacturing processes and workflows</li>
      <li>Integration of IoT, AI, and analytics for predictive insights</li>
      <li>Early validation of process changes and production scenarios</li>
      <li>Continuous synchronization between digital and physical environments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This digital-first approach enabled informed decision-making and reduced dependency
      on physical experimentation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced physical prototyping and shop-floor trial cycles</li>
      <li>Faster ramp-up and shortened time-to-market</li>
      <li>Lower material waste and improved sustainability metrics</li>
      <li>Higher confidence in production readiness</li>
      <li>Improved collaboration across engineering, manufacturing, and operations</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Takeaway -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      Digital twins and process preparation shift manufacturing optimization from
      reactive problem-solving to proactive, data-driven decision-making.
      By validating processes virtually, organizations can achieve faster, more
      sustainable, and more predictable production outcomes.
