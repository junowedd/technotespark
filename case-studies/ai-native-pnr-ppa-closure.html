  <!-- Sales summary -->
  <section class="case-summary">
    <p>
      Improved PPA outcomes and accelerated RTL-to-GDS closure by replacing manual,
      expert-driven P&amp;R flow tuning with an AI-native implementation strategy.
      This approach delivered faster convergence, higher productivity, and more
      predictable results compared to traditional Innovus and ICC2-based flows.

  <!-- Context -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Achieving optimal performance, power, and area (PPA) while meeting aggressive
      tape-out schedules is a persistent challenge for advanced SoC designs.
      Place-and-route tools play a central role in determining final design quality,
      yet implementation complexity continues to grow with each new technology node.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many design teams rely on established P&amp;R solutions such as Cadence Innovus
      and Synopsys ICC2, supported by extensive manual flow tuning and expert intervention.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenge -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional P&amp;R methodologies depend heavily on manual optimization loops,
      script-based experimentation, and expert intuition to balance competing PPA goals.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lengthy trial-and-error cycles to tune placement and routing parameters</li>
      <li>Strong dependence on a small number of expert engineers</li>
      <li>Limited scalability as design size and complexity increase</li>
      <li>Inconsistent results across projects and teams</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As schedules tighten, these manual approaches become a major bottleneck to
      predictable and timely design closure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why traditional flows fall short -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional Flows Fall Short</h2>
    <p>
      While tools like Innovus and ICC2 offer powerful optimization engines, they
      fundamentally rely on human-driven flow construction and iterative refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach limits the exploration of the vast solution space available in
      modern designs and makes it difficult to consistently identify globally optimal
      PPA trade-offs within practical time constraints.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>
      An AI-native implementation strategy was introduced to fundamentally change how
      P&amp;R flows are created and optimized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of relying on manually crafted scripts, AI-generated RTL-to-GDS flows
      were automatically derived and tuned based on design priorities such as
      performance, power, and area.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Technical execution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated exploration of placement and routing strategies</li>
      <li>AI-driven optimization loops replacing manual parameter tuning</li>
      <li>Production-ready flows generated with full transparency</li>
      <li>Seamless integration across the RTL-to-GDS implementation chain</li>
      <li>Natural-language access to tool knowledge and commands via AI assist</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This approach enabled broader and deeper design space exploration while
      maintaining deterministic, verifiable results suitable for sign-off.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Faster convergence to PPA targets compared to manual flows</li>
      <li>Significant reduction in engineering effort and tuning cycles</li>
      <li>More consistent results across designs and teams</li>
      <li>Improved predictability of RTL-to-GDS schedules</li>
      <li>Higher overall design productivity and confidence</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Takeaway -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      As implementation complexity increases, manual flow tuning reaches its limits.
      AI-native place-and-route optimization offers a scalable, repeatable path to
      faster PPA closure and more predictable design outcomes.
