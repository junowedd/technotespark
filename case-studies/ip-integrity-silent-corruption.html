  <!-- Sales summary -->
  <section class="case-summary">
    <p>
      Enabled early detection of silent IP corruption in complex SoC designs by introducing
      automated IP integrity verification before sign-off.
      This approach eliminated late-stage surprises, reduced re-spin risk, and significantly
      improved confidence in tape-out readiness.

  <!-- Context -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs rely heavily on third-party and internal IP blocks
      to manage complexity and accelerate development. These IP blocks are commonly treated
      as black boxes, assumed to remain unchanged from integration through final sign-off.
    </p>
    <p>
      As physical design flows become increasingly automated and aggressive, preserving IP
      integrity throughout implementation has become a critical challenge—especially in
      advanced nodes and large-scale SoCs.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenge -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      In real-world design flows, IP blocks are not always as immutable as assumed.
      During placement, routing, optimization, and metal fill stages, subtle and unintended
      modifications can occur inside IP regions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated routing or fill shapes intruding into IP boundaries</li>
      <li>Minor geometry changes that remain DRC-clean</li>
      <li>Label or text mismatches leading to late LVS issues</li>
      <li>Incomplete or overlooked IP placement and routing guidelines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These silent errors often surface only at sign-off—or after tape-out—creating
      re-spin risk, schedule impact, and uncertainty in design closure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why traditional checks fail -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional Checks Fall Short</h2>
    <p>
      Standard DRC and LVS flows validate rule compliance, not design intent.
      As long as layouts remain rule-clean, unintended IP modifications frequently pass
      undetected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manual inspection is impractical for modern SoCs containing hundreds or thousands
      of IP instances distributed across deep hierarchies, leaving a critical verification gap.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>
      To close this gap, an automated IP integrity verification methodology was introduced
      using pattern-based comparison against golden IP references.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective was clear: ensure that every IP instance in the final layout exactly
      matches its original reference in geometry, hierarchy, and text—before sign-off.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Technical execution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Identification of all IP instances regardless of hierarchy or naming</li>
      <li>Exhaustive comparison against golden reference layouts</li>
      <li>Detection of any added, deleted, or modified geometry within IP regions</li>
      <li>Verification of routing and fill interactions affecting IP integrity</li>
      <li>Explicit validation of text and label consistency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This automated flow provided complete visibility into both internal IP modifications
      and external interactions, even when traditional DRC and LVS reported clean results.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Early detection of silent IP corruption before sign-off</li>
      <li>Elimination of late-stage IP-related surprises</li>
      <li>Reduced re-spin risk and improved schedule predictability</li>
      <li>Higher confidence in design intent preservation</li>
      <li>Scalable verification across large, IP-heavy SoCs</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Takeaway -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      As SoC complexity increases, IP integrity can no longer be assumed—it must be verified.
      Automated IP integrity checking closes a critical blind spot left by traditional
      physical verification flows and strengthens overall sign-off robustness.
