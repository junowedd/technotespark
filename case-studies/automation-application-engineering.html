    <!-- INTRO -->
    <section>
      <p>
        This case study describes how application engineering practices
        were applied to support automation projects in customer-specific
        production environments. The focus was on translating technical
        requirements into reliable and maintainable system solutions.

    <!-- CHALLENGE -->
    <section>
      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Automation systems needed to be adapted to diverse customer
        environments with varying technical constraints. Key challenges
        included system integration, commissioning stability, and
        effective communication between customers and internal teams.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SOLUTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        An application-driven engineering approach was adopted, focusing
        on close collaboration with customers and internal stakeholders.
        Standardized automation concepts were adapted to specific use
        cases, supported by structured testing and validation.
