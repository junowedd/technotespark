  <!-- Sales summary -->
  <section class="case-summary">
    <p>
      Reduced late-stage verification surprises and tape-out risk by introducing sign-off-quality
      verification earlier in the design flow.
      This shift-left strategy shortened iteration cycles, improved productivity, and increased
      confidence in block and full-chip integration.

  <!-- Context -->
  <section>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Modern IC design has evolved into a highly concurrent process. Block-level IP development,
      full-chip integration, and system-level optimization now proceed in parallel to meet
      aggressive schedules and market demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this concurrency improves throughput, it also increases verification complexity,
      creating a growing risk of late-stage surprises during sign-off and tape-out.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Challenge -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional verification flows follow a linear model, where sign-off-quality checks are
      deferred until late implementation stages. In concurrent design environments, this model
      introduces several critical challenges.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Frequent block and chip-level iterations driven by late discoveries</li>
      <li>Long turnaround times for early design rule checking</li>
      <li>Millions of low-priority errors obscuring real design risks</li>
      <li>Costly rework cycles during routing and chip finishing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These inefficiencies consume engineering resources and undermine schedule predictability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why traditional flows fall short -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Traditional Flows Fall Short</h2>
    <p>
      Conventional verification requires designers to exit implementation tools, run external
      sign-off checks, analyze massive error reports, and re-enter the design environment to
      apply fixes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This long-loop process is particularly inefficient during early design stages, when layouts
      are still evolving and many reported issues are not yet relevant.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>
      A shift-left verification strategy was introduced to move sign-off-quality verification
      and reliability analysis into earlier design and implementation stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal was to provide designers with trusted verification results while layouts were still
      fluid—reducing unnecessary iterations and enabling informed design decisions sooner.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Technical execution -->
  <section>
    <h2>Technical Execution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Selective DRC execution to suppress irrelevant early-stage violations</li>
      <li>Targeted LVS checks focused on high-risk connectivity issues</li>
      <li>Integration of verification directly within P&amp;R environments</li>
      <li>Real-time debug and immediate validation of applied fixes</li>
      <li>Early reliability and multi-physics analysis for EM and IR drop</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This approach transformed verification from a late-stage gate into a continuous,
      design-stage feedback mechanism.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Significant reduction in early-stage verification runtimes</li>
      <li>Fewer late-stage surprises during sign-off</li>
      <li>Shortened overall design iteration cycles</li>
      <li>Improved designer productivity and focus</li>
      <li>Higher confidence in tape-out readiness</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Takeaway -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      In modern concurrent design environments, verification cannot remain a late-stage activity.
      Shifting sign-off verification left enables faster closure, reduced risk, and more
      predictable tape-out outcomes.
