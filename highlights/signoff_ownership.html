  “Can you walk us through a time when you owned sign-off readiness
  under tight schedule constraints?”

  <details>
    <summary><strong>My Talking Points</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Late-stage ASIC approaching tape-out with unresolved DRC and manufacturability risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Task:</strong> Own end-to-end sign-off readiness without impacting schedule.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Identified systematic violations, worked directly with layout and foundry teams, and prioritized fixes based on manufacturing risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Achieved first-time-right tape-out with no critical sign-off issues.</li>
    </ul>

  “How do you decide whether a violation requires a local fix
  versus a systematic layout or rule-level change?”

  <details>
    <summary><strong>My Talking Points</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for spatial repetition and pattern dependency.</li>
      <li>Evaluate impact on manufacturability and OPC sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Prefer systematic fixes when violations indicate process interaction.</li>
      <li>Balance risk vs. schedule when deciding scope of change.</li>
    </ul>

  “What trade-offs do you consider between verification closure
  and manufacturing robustness?”

  <details>
    <summary><strong>My Talking Points</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Short-term closure vs. long-term yield and stability.</li>
      <li>Foundry guidance and silicon history.</li>
      <li>Risk of re-spin outweighs small schedule gain.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
