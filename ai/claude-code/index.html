        Exploring AI-assisted development through structured prompting,
        workflows, and reasoning experiments.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This track focuses on how large language models (Claude) can augment
        human thinking and software development.
        The emphasis is on prompt design, workflow patterns, and reflective evaluation,
        rather than raw output generation.

      <h2>How I Use AI</h2>
      <p>
        I treat AI as a cognitive partner, not a replacement.
        The goal is to improve reasoning quality, speed up iteration,
        and surface alternative perspectives while maintaining human control.

  <h2>How This Connects to My EDA & Career Work</h2>
  <p>
    My exploration of AI and Claude Code builds on decades of experience
    in complex engineering decision-making, verification sign-off,
    and cross-functional technical leadership.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than treating AI as a replacement for engineering judgment,
    I focus on using it to augment reasoning, clarify design intent,
    and accelerate iterative problem solving in technically constrained environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    This mirrors many real-world EDA scenarios, where ambiguity,
    competing constraints, and incomplete information must be navigated
    through structured thinking and disciplined methodology.
