<h1>Stochastic Effects in Advanced Lithography</h1>

<p>
In advanced semiconductor lithography, many process variations are
<strong>statistical rather than deterministic</strong>.
Even under identical process conditions, the printed results may vary
due to fundamental physical and chemical randomness.
These phenomena are commonly referred to as <em>stochastic effects</em>.
</p>

<h2>Why Stochastic Effects Matter</h2>

<p>
As feature sizes continue to shrink, especially for critical layers,
lithography outcomes can no longer be described by a single expected value.
Instead, they must be understood as <strong>distributions</strong>
characterized by variability and tail risk.
</p>

<h2>Key Sources of Stochastic Effects</h2>

<h3>1. Photon Shot Noise</h3>
<p>
Light exposure is quantized at the photon level.
For a given exposure dose, the number of photons arriving at a local region
follows a statistical distribution.
As a result, local dose fluctuations occur even when the global dose is fixed.
</p>

<h3>2. Resist Stochastic Variability</h3>
<p>
Photoresist reactions such as acid generation, diffusion, and quenching
occur at the molecular scale.
These reactions are inherently random, leading to local variations in
feature edges and critical dimensions.
</p>

<h3>3. Random Defect Formation</h3>
<p>
The combined effect of photon and resist stochasticity can result in
random printing failures.
Examples include missing contacts, broken lines, or unintended bridges.
These defects do not appear at fixed locations and cannot be predicted deterministically.
</p>

<strong>Key takeaway:</strong><br>
Stochastic effects cannot be eliminated completely.
They must be managed statistically by controlling variability
and reducing the probability of extreme failures.
