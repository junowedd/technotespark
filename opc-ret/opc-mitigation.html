<h1>How OPC Mitigates Stochastic Effects</h1>

<p>
Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) was originally developed to correct
deterministic optical distortions.
For advanced nodes, OPC has evolved to address stochastic variability
by improving robustness rather than attempting perfect correction.
</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<div class="note">
<strong>OPC does not eliminate randomness.</strong><br>
Instead, it reduces sensitivity to randomness and minimizes the probability
of failure in the tails of the distribution.
</div>

<h2>Targeting the Center of a Safe Distribution</h2>

<p>
Rather than targeting the nominal mean critical dimension (CD),
OPC may intentionally bias the target toward the
<strong>center of the process-safe distribution</strong>.
This reduces the likelihood that stochastic variations push features
beyond manufacturing limits.
</p>

<h2>Mitigating Photon Shot Noise</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reducing CD sensitivity to dose variations</li>
  <li>Optimizing assist features to improve exposure uniformity</li>
  <li>Stabilizing edge placement under local dose fluctuations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mitigating Resist Stochastic Variability</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Smoothing edge fragmentation to avoid amplifying local randomness</li>
  <li>Favoring robust feature shapes over aggressive correction</li>
  <li>Optimizing for CD distribution rather than single-value accuracy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Handling Failure-Prone Patterns</h2>

<p>
Certain layout patterns are statistically more likely to fail due to
stochastic effects.
These <em>failure-prone patterns</em> may not fail deterministically,
but exhibit higher probabilities of defects.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Applying conservative bias to known weak patterns</li>
  <li>Reducing necking and marginal geometries</li>
  <li>Focusing optimization on high-risk hotspots</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Modern OPC is a statistical optimization process.
Success is measured by reduced variability, improved robustness,
and lower defect probability rather than perfect pattern fidelity.
