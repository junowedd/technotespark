<h1>Single-Layer OPC Recipes in EUV Lithography</h1>

<p>
In modern EUV lithography, OPC is no longer a purely deterministic correction
process. Instead, it is a layer-specific strategy for managing
process variability, stochastic effects, and yield risk.
This note summarizes how a <strong>single-layer OPC recipe</strong> is structured
and why <strong>gate and contact layers require fundamentally different approaches</strong>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What Does a Single-Layer OPC Recipe Mean?</h2>

<p>
A single-layer OPC recipe is not a loose collection of correction rules.
It is a coherent definition of how one specific layer is corrected,
validated, and signed off under realistic manufacturing conditions.
</p>

<div class="note">
<strong>Conceptually, a single-layer OPC recipe combines:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Target CD definition</li>
  <li>Fragmentation strategy</li>
  <li>Biasing and context rules</li>
  <li>Assist feature strategy</li>
  <li>Handling of failure-prone patterns</li>
  <li>Verification and sign-off criteria</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Owning a layer means understanding how these elements interact
and knowing which lever to adjust when yield or printability issues appear.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>How OPC Commands Are Combined into a Layer Recipe</h2>

<p>
In practice, OPC commands are grouped logically rather than applied independently.
A simplified conceptual structure is shown below.
</p>

<pre>
OPCSET LAYER_OPC {
  TARGET        CD
  ITERATE / STOP
  FRAGMENT
  CONTEXT RULES
  SRAF STRATEGY
  FILTER (weak patterns)
  VERIFY
}
</pre>

<p>
This structure reflects how OPC engineers think about the problem:
not as isolated commands, but as a closed-loop system that balances
accuracy, robustness, and runtime.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why EUV Gate and Contact Layers Are Fundamentally Different</h2>

<p>
Although both gate and contact layers are critical, their physical shapes
and failure modes differ significantly.
As a result, their OPC recipes follow different optimization philosophies.
</p>

<h3>Physical and Failure Mode Differences</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gate layers</strong> consist of long, continuous lines where
      CD accuracy and edge placement directly impact device performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Contact layers</strong> consist of small, isolated holes where
      the primary risk is complete printing failure (missing contacts).</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<strong>Key distinction:</strong><br>
Gate OPC optimizes <em>precision</em>, while contact OPC optimizes <em>survival probability</em>.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>EUV Gate Layer OPC Recipe Characteristics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Target CD is close to the nominal design value</li>
  <li>Fine fragmentation to control edge placement and LER</li>
  <li>Aggressive context-aware biasing for dense vs isolated patterns</li>
  <li>Active use of assist features to stabilize imaging</li>
  <li>Tight verification criteria on CD and EPE</li>
</ul>

<p>
For gate layers, OPC aims to produce uniform, repeatable shapes.
Small deviations may be tolerated electrically, but variability must be minimized.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>EUV Contact Layer OPC Recipe Characteristics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Target CD is intentionally biased toward the safe side</li>
  <li>Coarser fragmentation to avoid amplifying stochastic noise</li>
  <li>Minimal or no use of assist features</li>
  <li>Simple, conservative bias rules</li>
  <li>Special handling of known failure-prone patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>
For contact layers, a slightly oversized contact is acceptable,
but a missing contact is catastrophic.
Therefore, OPC sacrifices nominal accuracy to reduce tail-risk failures.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<div class="note">
<ul>
  <li>A single-layer OPC recipe is a complete risk-management strategy.</li>
  <li>Gate OPC prioritizes CD control and edge fidelity.</li>
  <li>Contact OPC prioritizes printability and defect probability reduction.</li>
  <li>Understanding these differences is essential for owning a critical layer.</li>
</ul>
