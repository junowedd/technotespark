<h1>Why ASML and TSMC Use Partial ILT</h1>

<p>
Inverse Lithography Technology (ILT) provides the highest pattern fidelity
in computational lithography. However, despite its theoretical advantages,
<strong>full-chip ILT is not used in high-volume manufacturing</strong>.
This document explains why industry leaders such as ASML and TSMC
adopt <strong>partial ILT</strong> instead.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. What ILT Really Is</h2>

<p>
ILT formulates mask synthesis as a <strong>global optimization problem</strong>:
</p>

<pre>
Minimize wafer contour error
while enforcing mask manufacturability
</pre>

<p>
Unlike traditional OPC, ILT does not rely on local edge corrections.
Instead, it computes the optimal mask shape that best reproduces
the target wafer pattern.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
ILT provides the best possible lithographic solution — at a very high cost.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>2. What “Partial ILT” Means in Production</h2>

<p>
Partial ILT refers to the selective application of ILT
<strong>only to critical lithography hotspots</strong>,
rather than to the entire chip.
</p>

<pre>
Rule-based OPC   → Full chip
Model-based OPC  → Full chip
ILT              → Selected hotspots only
</pre>

<p>
Typically, hotspot regions represent less than 1% of the total layout area.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Why ASML and TSMC Use Partial ILT</h2>

<h3>3.1 Computational Cost Explosion</h3>

<p>
ILT uses pixel- or level-set-based mask representations,
which dramatically increase the number of optimization variables.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full-chip ILT runtime: weeks to months</li>
  <li>Hotspot ILT runtime: hours to days</li>
</ul>

<p>
From a return-on-investment perspective, applying ILT only where it matters
provides maximum benefit at minimal cost.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3.2 Mask Write and Inspection Limitations</h3>

<p>
ILT masks tend to be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highly curvilinear</li>
  <li>Extremely fragmented</li>
  <li>Dense with sub-resolution features</li>
</ul>

<p>
This results in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Excessive mask write time</li>
  <li>Increased mask cost</li>
  <li>Difficult inspection and repair</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight">
Mask shops cannot reliably support full-chip ILT masks at production scale.
</div>

<hr>

<h3>3.3 Diminishing Returns Compared to Model-based OPC</h3>

<p>
For the majority of layout patterns, well-calibrated model-based OPC
already meets CD and process window requirements.
</p>

<p>
ILT provides significant improvement only for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex 2D patterns</li>
  <li>Forbidden pitch regions</li>
  <li>Severe process window limiters</li>
</ul>

<p>
Applying ILT everywhere yields little additional benefit
while dramatically increasing cost.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3.4 Process Window Optimization Strategy</h3>

<p>
ILT is most effective when used to recover process window
in the most lithographically sensitive regions.
</p>

<p>
Since process window margin is not uniformly required across the chip,
selective ILT is the most efficient strategy.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Why ILT Is Not Fully Used in Production</h2>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Limitation</th>
    <th>Impact on Production</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Runtime</td>
    <td>Violates tape-out schedules</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mask manufacturability</td>
    <td>High risk of mask write failure</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Inspection & repair</td>
    <td>Yield and reliability risk</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cost vs. benefit</td>
    <td>Economically unjustifiable</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>5. ASML vs. TSMC Perspective</h2>

<h3>ASML (Tool and Platform Provider)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on extending lithographic limits</li>
  <li>Develops full ILT and curvilinear mask solutions</li>
  <li>Research-driven approach</li>
</ul>

<h3>TSMC (High-Volume Manufacturer)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on throughput and yield stability</li>
  <li>Cost-sensitive decision making</li>
  <li>Production-driven approach</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight">
ASML asks: “Is it physically possible?”<br>
TSMC asks: “Can we manufacture it reliably at scale?”
</div>

<hr>

<h2>6. Production-Proven Strategy</h2>

<pre>
Most layout patterns      → Model-based OPC
Difficult hotspots        → Partial ILT
Extreme cases             → Layout re-design
</pre>

<hr>

<h2>7. I-ready Summary</h2>

<p>
<strong>
Although ILT delivers superior pattern fidelity, its computational cost
and mask manufacturability challenges prevent full-chip deployment.
Therefore, companies like ASML and TSMC use partial ILT, applying it
selectively to lithography hotspots where conventional OPC cannot meet
process window requirements.
</strong>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Final Takeaway</h2>

<ul>
  <li>ILT is the most powerful computational lithography technique</li>
  <li>Full-chip ILT is impractical for high-volume manufacturing</li>
  <li>Partial ILT offers the best balance between accuracy and cost</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>
Partial ILT is not a compromise — it is an optimized production strategy.
