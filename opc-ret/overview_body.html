Architecture</h1>
<p>Below 14nm, layout design is no longer about drawing shapes. It is
about <strong>constraining degrees of freedom</strong> to ensure
manufacturability, yield, and predictable OPC convergence.</p>
<p>In advanced technology nodes, many geometries that are DRC-clean are
fundamentally non-manufacturable. Therefore, the role of layout
automation and PCells must shift from geometry generation to
<strong>encoding manufacturing intent</strong>.</p>

<p>User Parameters ↓ Topology Definition ↓ Technology Rules (PDK) ↓ DFM
/ OPC Guards ↓ Layout Geometry</p>
<p>A well-designed PCell does not rely on post-layout fixes. Instead, it
prevents invalid structures from being generated in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Good layout architecture removes freedom, not adds
it.</strong></p>
