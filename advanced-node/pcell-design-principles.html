Principles for Advanced Nodes</h1>

<p>The primary responsibility of a PCell is not to generate layout
quickly, but to <strong>prevent invalid layout from ever being
created</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-be-forbidden-at-the-pcell-level">What Should Be
Forbidden at the PCell Level</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continuous transistor width</li>
<li>Arbitrary gate length selection</li>
<li>User-controlled gate cut placement</li>
<li>Single-fin devices in product mode</li>
<li>Fin pitch modification</li>
<li>Arbitrary fin termination near active edges</li>
<li>Free contact or via placement</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-forbid-instead-of-fix">Why Forbid Instead of Fix</h2>
<p>OPC and DRC are verification tools. They are not design tools.</p>
<p>If a structure must be corrected by OPC, it should not be generated
by default.</p>
<h2 id="pcm-vs-product-separation">PCM vs Product Separation</h2>
<p>Exploration and production require different freedoms.</p>
<p>if pcmMode: allow exploration else: strictly enforce rules</p>
<h2 id="guiding-principle">Guiding Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A good PCell does not make designers smarter. It makes bad designs
impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This principle scales teams, technologies, and manufacturing
outcomes.</p>
