# PCell Design Principles for Advanced Nodes

The primary responsibility of a PCell
is not to generate layout quickly,
but to **prevent invalid layout from ever being created**.

## What Should Be Forbidden at the PCell Level

- Continuous transistor width
- Arbitrary gate length selection
- User-controlled gate cut placement
- Single-fin devices in product mode
- Fin pitch modification
- Arbitrary fin termination near active edges
- Free contact or via placement

## Why Forbid Instead of Fix

OPC and DRC are verification tools.
They are not design tools.

If a structure must be corrected by OPC,
it should not be generated by default.

## PCM vs Product Separation

Exploration and production require different freedoms.

if pcmMode:
allow exploration
else:
strictly enforce rules


## Guiding Principle

> A good PCell does not make designers smarter.
> It makes bad designs impossible.

This principle scales teams, technologies,
and manufacturing outcomes.
