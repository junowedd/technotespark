**Semiconductor Physical Verification & Manufacturing Readiness Portfolio**

Personal technical portfolio covering **physical verification**, **EDA sign-off methodologies**,
and **design-to-manufacturing workflows** across advanced ASIC and foundry programs.

## AI Case Studies
AI is often discussed in terms of models.  
In practice, AI succeeds or fails as a system.

## My Role & Background

I am a senior semiconductor professional with over 29 years of experience spanning **physical verification, sign-off ownership, and design-to-manufacturing enablement** across EMEA and APAC.  
My work has focused on **foundry-facing verification methodologies**, including DRC, LVS, PERC, RET, and manufacturing readiness at advanced and legacy nodes.  
I have supported complex ASIC and packaging programs by bridging **EDA technology, customer design challenges, and business objectives**.  
In addition to technical leadership, I have led **high-value B2B engagements**, collaborating closely with engineering teams, foundries, and executive stakeholders.  
This repository reflects both my **hands-on technical depth** and my experience in **translating sign-off complexity into actionable solutions**.
