<h1>ASIC Customer Enablement & Technical Ownership</h1>

<p>
  This page highlights real-world customer application enablement
  experience across ASIC programs, focusing on technical ownership,
  execution support, and successful adoption from evaluation to tape-out.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>
  In customer-facing ASIC engagements, success depends not only on
  technology capability but on the ability to translate customer
  requirements into executable, manufacturable solutions under
  schedule and risk constraints.
</p>

<p>
  My role consistently focused on acting as the technical bridge between
  customer design teams, internal R&amp;D, EDA flows, and manufacturing
  partners.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Typical Customer Engagement Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-sales technical evaluation and solution alignment</li>
  <li>Customer design flow assessment and gap analysis</li>
  <li>Hands-on support during physical design, verification, and sign-off</li>
  <li>Issue triage across design, tool, and manufacturing domains</li>
  <li>Guidance through tape-out readiness and production handoff</li>
</ul>

<h2>Representative Enablement Scenario (STAR)</h2>

<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>
  An ASIC customer was evaluating advanced-node technology for a
  high-complexity SoC with aggressive performance and schedule targets.
  The customer team faced challenges integrating physical verification,
  manufacturability requirements, and sign-off criteria into their
  existing flow.
</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>
  Provide end-to-end technical enablement to reduce adoption risk,
  ensure sign-off readiness, and build customer confidence in both
  the technology and supporting tools.
</p>

<h3>Action</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reviewed customer design and verification flow to identify gaps
      against foundry and sign-off requirements</li>
  <li>Provided hands-on guidance for DRC/LVS/DFM execution and interpretation</li>
  <li>Helped distinguish local layout issues from systematic
      manufacturability risks</li>
  <li>Coordinated across internal R&amp;D, tool support, and manufacturing
      teams to resolve blocking issues</li>
  <li>Translated complex technical findings into clear, actionable
      recommendations for the customer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Result</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Customer successfully progressed from evaluation to tape-out</li>
  <li>Reduced late-stage sign-off risk and avoided schedule slips</li>
  <li>Strengthened customer trust and long-term engagement</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Key Enablement Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Customer success over tool usage:</strong>
      Focus on enabling customer outcomes rather than demonstrating features</li>
  <li><strong>Risk-based decision making:</strong>
      Prioritize fixes based on manufacturability and re-spin risk</li>
  <li><strong>Clear communication:</strong>
      Convert complex technical issues into practical guidance</li>
  <li><strong>Ownership mindset:</strong>
      Treat customer tape-out success as a shared responsibility</li>
</ul>
