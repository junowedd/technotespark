<!-- SUMMARY -->
<div class="section-bar">
  <h2>Professional Sales Leadership Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Led international sales growth and customer success initiatives for
    <span class="highlight">ELMOS Semiconductor</span>, a leading automotive
    ASIC and ASSP supplier, with a strong focus on <strong>Asia and Pacific</strong>.
    Built and scaled a product-line–driven sales organization supporting
    long-term engagement with <strong>automotive Tier-1 customers</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- STAR SUCCESS -->
<div class="section-bar">
  <h2>ELMOS Success Story (STAR)</h2>

  <h3>S – Situation</h3>
  <p>
    ELMOS had strong analog/mixed-signal capabilities, but limited structured
    presence and scalability in Asia despite clear demand from automotive Tier-1 customers.
  </p>

  <h3>T – Task</h3>
  <p>
    Establish and scale the Asian sales footprint, build a robust product-line
    organization, and create long-term Tier-1 customer relationships while
    ensuring sustainable revenue and margin growth.
  </p>

  <h3>A – Action</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Founded three local offices in Asia with full end-to-end setup</li>
    <li>Built a seven-product-line–driven sales and application organization</li>
    <li>Worked directly with Tier-1 customers to align ASIC/ASSP solutions with system and quality requirements</li>
    <li>Established regional distribution and partner strategy across Asia and Europe</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>R – Result</h3>
  <p>
    Delivered <strong>50% revenue growth within one year (2010–2011)</strong>,
    establishing stable regional operations and long-term Tier-1 customer trust.
  </p>

  <div class="quote">
    “Built the Asian sales organization from the ground up and delivered
    50% revenue growth by combining local execution with product-line discipline.”
  </div>
</div>

<!-- STAR CHALLENGE -->
<div class="section-bar">
  <h2>Challenge & Failure Story (STAR)</h2>

  <h3>S – Situation</h3>
  <p>
    Early Asian market entry underestimated the importance of local presence
    and long-term commitment expected by automotive Tier-1 customers.
  </p>

  <h3>T – Task</h3>
  <p>
    Recover stalled engagements, rebuild trust, and adapt the go-to-market
    approach without compromising quality or internal focus.
  </p>

  <h3>A – Action</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Shifted to a hybrid model combining direct local presence and partners</li>
    <li>Accelerated on-site application engineering support</li>
    <li>Personally engaged senior engineering and purchasing stakeholders</li>
    <li>Strengthened cross-functional alignment between sales, applications, and product lines</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>R – Result</h3>
  <p>
    Reopened stalled Tier-1 programs and established a repeatable, trust-based
    engagement model that directly supported subsequent revenue growth.
  </p>

  <div class="quote">
    “In automotive semiconductor sales, trust, proximity, and commitment are as
    critical as technical excellence.”
  </div>
</div>

<!-- REFLECTION -->
<div class="section-bar">
  <h2>Reflection – What I Would Do Differently</h2>
  <p>
    With today’s experience, I would front-load local execution earlier,
    invest sooner in on-site application support and senior-level engagement,
    and define clearer go/no-go criteria for Tier-1 opportunities.
  </p>

  <div class="quote">
    “Move faster on local presence and senior stakeholder alignment — because trust drives outcomes.”
