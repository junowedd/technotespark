<h1>Pre-sales Evaluation & Technical Decision Support</h1>

<p>
This page documents pre-sales and early engagement activities where
technical depth was used to support customer decision-making,
reduce adoption risk, and align solutions with real-world ASIC constraints.
</p>

<h2>Typical Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Technical evaluation of customer requirements and feasibility</li>
  <li>Architecture and flow discussions prior to tool or technology adoption</li>
  <li>Identification of risk areas early in the sales cycle</li>
  <li>Clear communication of trade-offs and constraints</li>
</ul>

<h2>Representative Scenario</h2>
<p>
During pre-sales phases, customers often face uncertainty around
advanced-node readiness, sign-off complexity, and manufacturability.
My role focused on clarifying these unknowns before commitment.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reviewed customer design intent and constraints</li>
  <li>Mapped requirements to supported flows and capabilities</li>
  <li>Helped customers make informed, technically sound decisions</li>
</ul>
